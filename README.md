## Installation

Install with `pip` or your preferred dependency management tool.

```bash
pip install catppuccin
```

## Usage

```python
>>> from catppuccin import Flavour
>>> Flavour.latte().mauve.hex
'8839ef'
>>> Flavour.mocha().teal.rgb
(148, 226, 213)
```

`Flavour` is a [`dataclass`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html),
so you can inspect its fields to get access to the full set of colour names and values:

```python
>>> from dataclasses import fields
>>> flavour = Flavour.frappe()
>>> for field in fields(flavour):
        colour = getattr(flavour, field.name)
        print(f"{field.name}: #{colour.hex}")
rosewater: #f2d5cf
flamingo: #eebebe
pink: #f4b8e4
...
base: #303446
mantle: #292c3c
crust: #232634
```

## Pygments Styles

This package provides a Pygments style for each of the four Catppuccin flavours.

Install Catppuccin with the `pygments` feature to include the relevant dependencies:

```bash
pip install catppuccin[pygments]
```

The styles are registered as importlib entrypoints, which allows Pygments to
find them by name:

```python
>>> from pygments.styles import get_style_by_name
>>> get_style_by_name("catppuccin-frappe")
catppuccin.extras.pygments.FrappeStyle
```

The following style names are available:

 - `catppuccin-latte`
 - `catppuccin-frappe`
 - `catppuccin-macchiato`
 - `catppuccin-mocha`

They can also be accessed by directly importing them:

```python
from catppuccin.extras.pygments import MacchiatoStyle
```
